This is a project of tester for hydraulic brake controller of NF6D tram, performed using STM32F104C6T6 MCU. It passes signals between a PC unit and the controller, allowing to simulate behavior of real tram while monitoring the signal levels and test whether or not controller works correctly.

I provided only the files I've been working at.

The project was made for Municipal Transport Service of Łódź. It hasn't been finished yet.
